# Installing

To begin setting up the plugin on your server it will need to be installed onto all servers
you plan to use it on.

!!! warning
    It is recommended to **stop** your server while installing plugins

## Downloading
- Download the *.jar* file from one of the [download](../#downloads) options
- Place this file into the */plugins* directory of your server

## Plugin Hooks
This plugin has additional features which can be used by adding optional plugins. These are not needed
but can extend functionality. You can find them below along with a brief description of what feature they
enable.

* [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) *Allows use of custom fishing regions*

## Setup
Once all the required plugins are installing onto the server you can go ahead and run the server. **Custom Fishing** should
auto-generate some files by default. Have a look through these files for a base idea of how the plugin is configured.
I recommend looking [here](../configuration) for an extensive guide on how to configure the plugin.
