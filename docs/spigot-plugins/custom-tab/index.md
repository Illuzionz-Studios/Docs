# Custom Tab

**Custom Tab** is a plugin designed to display information to the player in the most convient ways. It does this
by having custom tab columns that can be shown when the player meets certain requirements. It also takes advantage of
the **BossBar** and **ActionBar** to display announcements or other info. It also makes use tags above the head to display
a variety of information. It does this all completely **asynchronous** meaning it has little affect on server performance.
