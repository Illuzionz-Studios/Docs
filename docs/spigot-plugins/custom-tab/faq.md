## Known Bugs
??? bug "When having less than 4 columns it bugs out then fixes itself when a player joins"
    This happens because the plugin intentionally delays adding the player to the tab
    when they join. This is because if the player is added to the list too fast skins of
    the player bug out. It is recommended to keep the tab at 4 columns as it is most stable
    that way. Having less columns works but it has this slight caveat.

??? bug "Player skins don't apply on join sometimes"
    This is another bug which sometimes occurs when adding players to the tab. This is currently
    being looked into and will be fixed soon.
