It is used as an identifier to tell rewards apart, isn't used in the actual physical or virtual reward. name : \"Demo Reward\" Commands A list of commands that will be executed by the CONSOLE when the player finds this reward. For example, you can use the placeholder {player} to use the player's name. If this list is empty or set to null it won't execute any commands. This means you can remove this option from the config and no commands will be loaded. commands : - \"msg {player} demo\" Items A list of custom items are defined each by the options under a key. For example, here the options are set under \"sword:\", you can add as many you like under the \"items:\" key. items : sword : chance : 100 # (1) item-name : \"&a&lMy Custom Sword\" # (2) lore : # (3) - \"&7Made from CustomFishing!\" amount : 1 # (4) material : DIAMOND_SWORD # (5) model-data : 0 # (6) enchants : # (7) - \"SHARPNESS:5\" glowing : false # (8) unbreakable : false # (9) hide-flags : false # (10) damage : 0 # (11) This is the chance that if this reward is found this particular item will be given. These chances are independent of other items so if two items have a chance of 75, a calculation of 75 out of 100 will be calculated for each item. This is the custom display name of the item. If set to a blank string or set to null then no custom name will be used. This is the custom lore for the item. If the list is empty or set to null then no custom lore will be used. This is the amount of this item to give to the player. The material enum to use for the item. Can be found here If this item should have custom model data for texture packs then set that here. If set to null then this won't be set. These are the enchants to apply to the item. They are defined as ENCHANT_ENUM:LEVEL, if the enchant defined is invalid then that enchant won't be applied. If the list is empty or set to null then no enchants will be used. All the available enchant enums can be found here A simple option to make the item have the enchanted glowing effect but any actual enchantments. Will automatically make the hide-flags option true. If this item cannot be broken and does not use up durability. This indicates that flags such as enchants and unbreakable flags will not be displayed on the item. Damage to the item (for durability). Remaining durability is (durability of item - damage). Broadcasts A set of broadcasts to send to every online member. If this list is empty or set to null it won't send any messages. This means you can remove this option from the config and no broadcasts will be loaded. broadcasts : - '&4&l(!) &c{player} &7found a &c&lLEGENDARY &7reward!' Titles Titles to send to the player when they find this reward. title must be set in order for the sub-title to also work. If either is an empty string or null its message will be treated as unset. title : \"&a&lYou found a reward\" sub-title : \"&7&oFound: Sword\" Weight This is the weight (chance) that this item has to be found out of all rewards that meet the player's requirements. How this works is it adds all the chances from rewards that can be found. For instance, if there are 3 rewards with a weight of 10, 2 with a weight of 3, and 1 with a weight of 0.5, the total is 36.5. So for the reward with weight 3, it has a 3/36.5 chance of being picked. weight : 4.5 Vanilla Rewards This is if the default vanilla fishing loot table will also reward something when this reward is found. For example, if this is set to 'true', if you find a reward it will also give you a fish item or enchantment book etc. If it is set to 'false', then only a custom reward will be given and no default fishing rewards from vanilla. vanilla-rewards : false Experience Amount This is the number of experience points to award the player when they find this reward. The default vanilla is from 1 to 6. The format for this is as a range, from one number to another. This is formatted as {number} to {number} . It can also be a singular number in which case that amount of experience will be rewarded every time. If this is set to null then no experience will be rewarded. exp-amount : \"1 to 6\" Sound This is the sound that is played for the player when they find this reward. These can be found here . If this is set to null then no sound will be played. sound : ENTITY_FIREWORK_ROCKET_TWINKLE Requirements Fishing rewards can have certain requirements to set where they can be found. You can use PlaceholderAPI placholders for the player catching the reward here. They are defined with the following format below and then each type will be expained. requirement : type : <REQUIREMENT TYPE> # (1) value : <FIRST INPUT> # (2) input : <SECOND INPUT> # (3) This is where you specify the type of requirement check. This is the first input value. This is at least needed for every type. This is the secondary input value. Only some types need it and it is for more comparision checks like numbers or strings. For a reward you can have multiple requirements by denoting each with an identifier like so. requirements : requirement1 : type : <REQUIREMENT TYPE> value : <FIRST INPUT> input : <SECOND INPUT> requirement2 : type : <REQUIREMENT TYPE> value : <FIRST INPUT> input : <SECOND INPUT> You can also have an inverted requirement type which means it checks if the condition is NOT TRUE, if so the requirement passes.

Main Config The first file to look over is the main file config.yml . This just contains basic options that apply throughout the plugin. config.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 settings : # The language file to use for the plugin # More language files (if available) can be found in the plugins locale folder. locale : en_US # (1) tab : # The default tab to show players if # they don't meet any requirements default : default # (2) This is the locale file to use for the plugin. It can be found in locales . This is the default tab to display (taken from /tabs) when a player doesn't meet any of the requirements for any tab. Custom Skins This plugin has the ability to display custom skins in tab elements. They are defined by a value and a signature. Custom skins can be defined in the skins.yml file by name where you can reference them later in other configs. Custom skins can be found/created at this website. They are defined in the config like so. skins.yml skinname : # (1) value : <VALUE OF SKIN> # (2) signature : <SIGNATURE OF SKIN> # (3) The identifier of this skin. This is the name to be used when referencing it from other configs. The value of this skin. Copied from the skin value section from https://mineskin.org/ . The signature of this skin. Copied from the skin signature section from https://mineskin.org/ .

They can be assigned with permissions and have options like the weight in the tab and how to display that player in-game. Players can have multiple groups but are prioritised by weight. They are defined with the format below. groups.yml groupname : # (1) # Permission for player to have this group. Set to blank here so all players have it permission : '' # (2) # The priority of this group, the player will have the group they qualify for that # has the highest weight. A higher weight is a higher priority weight : 1 # (3) display : # How to display this group on the tab tab : # (4) animations : # (5) - '&8Member &7%player_name%' interval : -1 # (6) This is the name of the group. This doesn't matter as isn't used anywhere else. This is the permission required for the player to have this group. If it is left blank like so that means every player will have this group. This is the weight of this group. If a player has multiple group their assigned group will be the one with the highest weight. If the number is higher that group will be prioritised. E.g, A weight of 99 has higher priorty than a weight of 56. This is the Dynamic Text element to display in the tab for this group. As explained later this is passed through the variable {group_format} . Example owner : permission : tab.owner weight : 99 display : tab : animations : - '&4Owner &c%player_name%' - '&cO&4wner &c%player_name%' - '&4O&cw&4ner &c%player_name%' - '&4Ow&cn&4er &c%player_name%' - '&4Own&ce&4r &c%player_name%' - '&4Owne&cr &c%player_name%' interval : 10 Tab Columns The Tab is comprised of Tab Columns. These are a set of elements that will display. They have the nice feature of pagination so you can have multiple pages of elements. Each column can also have a title element to show what each column displays. So simply a tab column is a list of elements with a title at the top. They are defined by the following format columns/column.yml # Id of this column for referencing it name : \"features\" # Page options page : # If enabled, the total number of elements go over # the below 'elements' option, it will create a new # page and display the remaining elements on all the # new pages enabled : true # (1) # Maximum amount of pages to create.

If the # elements go over this they will flow to the next # page elements : 20 # (3) # Interval in ticks between scrolling pages.

This is limited by the tab update # interval. Recommended being -1 if only # has one frame as doesn't actually animate interval : -1 # The title of this tab column title : # (6) # The custom skin for this tab element. There are multiple ways they're # defined. You can set the 'name' element here which will take # a skin from the skins.yml file. Otherwise you can directly specify the # 'value' and 'signature' like in skins.yml but right here under 'skin:' skin : name : red # These are the different animation frames for # this text. Each text element is iterated through # to create a dynamic animation. Colors are supported here # along with 1.16+ HEX codes. Hex codes can be used with # '&#111111'.

This is the maximum amount of pages to create. This is the number of elements per page. It controls how long each column is, 20 is recommended This is the interval (in ticks) between changing pages. This is the tab item to display page information. It is displayed at the bottom of the column where there is more than 1 page. This is the tab item to display at the top of the column if titles are enabled for the tab. This is a list of tab items that will display on the tab column. Each is defined by an identifier. This doesn't matter as they are just added in the order they are defined.

This is the weight of this tab. If a player meets the requirements for multiple tabs, they will have the one with the highest weight. If the number is higher that tab will be prioritised. E.g, A weight of 99 has higher priorty than a weight of 56. This is if each tab column will display a title at the top defined in their title property. This is the maximum width for each element on the tab. Anything above will be trimmed. This is a list of columns to display on the tab.

This is a list of dynamic text elements that display in the footer of the tab. Components Alot of configuration options take the format of certain components. This will explain the format for each component so you can refer to here when it mentions it uses that component. Dynamic Text Dynamic text is a text element that animated. It contains several frames along with the interval between changing frames. The format is as follows. # These are the different animation frames for # this text. Each text element is iterated through # to create a dynamic animation. Colors are supported here # along with 1.16+ HEX codes. Hex codes can be used with # '&#111111'.

This is the time in ticks before each frame will change to the next. This is recommended to be set at -1 if there is only 1 frame so the plugin doesn't bother updating it.

It contains a Dynamic Text element along with options for custom skins and centered text. The format is as follows. item : ping : FIVE # (1) center : false # (2) skin : # (3) name : <SKIN NAME> value : <SKIN VALUE> signature : <SKIN SIGNATURE> requirement : # (4) type : string equals value : '%player_name%' input : IlluzionzDev animations : # (5) - 'First Frame' - 'Second Frame' interval : 20 This is the ping to display for this element. The options are ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE for the different ping bars in the tablist. This is if the text should be a centered element in the tab. This is the custom skin for this element. The name parameter tries to find a custom skin defined in skins.yml . If you want to implement a specfic skin just for this element you can directly specify the value and signature here. This is the requirement for this tab element to display. If conditions aren't met it won't be displayed. This is the dynamic text element of the tab item.

These are custom checks that have alot of power to display tabs and elements in certain scenarios for a more dynamic tab. They are defined with the following format below and then each type will be expained. requirement : type : <REQUIREMENT TYPE> # (1) value : <FIRST INPUT> # (2) input : <SECOND INPUT> # (3) This is where you specify the type of requirement check.
